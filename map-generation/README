This is testcode mainly that looks at maps and generates C code.
This is NOT meant for production and are only utility scripts. 

Note the C code generated includes typedefs so it can run on amd64 architecture and should be changed when porting
to the stm32

This also uses a venv.
Please run 'install' to setup the venv

Run 'update_requirements' if a package is updated in the venv

Before running, make sure to source the venv
