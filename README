This is testcode mainly that looks at maps and generates C code.

Note the C code generated includes typedefs so it can run on amd64 architecture and should be changed when porting
to the stm32

This also uses a venv.
Please run 'install' to setup the venv

Run 'update_requirements' if a package is updated in the venv
